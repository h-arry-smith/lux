# The Lux Project
An open-source iniative to create a fully fledged entertainment lighting 
environment. With the goal to explore new ways of manipulating intelligent 
features and enabling innovative lighting design.

This project consists of three primary parts: Lux, Lumen and Candela.

An early prototype of this design was first developed in Ruby, and now the 
development focus has switched to a more detailed rebuild in Rust.

## Lux
Lux is a DSL for describing lighting states in a declerative way, inspired by
HTML & CSS

## Lumen
Lumen is the lighting engine that allows the creation and manipulation of 
fixtures, and output the corresponding control signals.

## Candela
Candela is a interactive lighting console environment that usees Lux & Lumen to
allow designers to create shows with ease.
